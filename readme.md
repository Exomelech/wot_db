# *Node.js server-side API*
###### Its a small server API based on Node.js, using the [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/ru/ "Express framework") and [MySQL DB](https://www.mysql.com/ "MySQL") with [mysql2 module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) . The main goal is to learn the basics of how the API works on the server side and to understand how it works '*under the hood*'.
###### Client side bundled with webpack, used [babelrc](https://babeljs.io/) to parse ES6+ syntaxes to ES5 for better copability with olders or legacy browsers.
###### Backend requests for mysql cached for better response time of the future same type requests. Also write small mysql api for parse requests to db.
